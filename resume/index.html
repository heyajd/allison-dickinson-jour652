  <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Communications Officer</h3>
    <h4>Office of Diversity & Inclusion, University of Maryland</h4>
    <h5>2020-present</h5>
      <p>I serve the vice president for diversity and inclusion and ODI’s units on their marketing and communication needs, including media relations, graphic design, social media management and a website redesign encompassing all of ODI’s reporting units. I have grown the subscriber list for ODI’s weekly MailChimp newsletter by 77% over two and a half years; Instagram following by 17% and Twitter following by 13%. Special projects I’ve supported include the #UMDSolidarity campaign, #CROWNDay photography campaign, the Bowie State-UMD Social Justice Alliance’s first Forward with Hope spring symposium, the first UMD Digital Accessibility Empathy Lab and the upcoming Land-Grab UMD webinar.</p>

    <h3>Director of Communication</h3>
    <h4>The Field School</h4>
    <h5>2016-2020</h5>
      <p>I was a one-person shop responsible for all communications and marketing content for a 370-student independent school, including strategy, graphic design, video production and editing, photography and social media management. I wrote the weekly e-newsletter and created the school’s magazine on a roughly biannual basis from concept through production. I also managed a website redesign and transition to a responsive website platform. I created the communications plan around a major transition in school. One time I created 26 posters in two days for a Board retreat.</p>

    <h3>Development Communication Coordinator</h3>
    <h4>WAMU 88.5</h4>
    <h5>2011-2016</h5>
      <p>As part of the major giving team, I created email fundraising for major donors which had an average open rate of 30%, and worked with the station’s communications team to establish a presence for the development department on the station’s social media, including our first foray into Giving Tuesday. One major giving appeal I wrote raised over $150,000.</p>
